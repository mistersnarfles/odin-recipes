    <p>This is a breakfast burrito I have been making for a long time. Very easy to make
        with few ingredients.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients (serves 5 people)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>15 eggs</li>
        <li>5 tortillas</li>
        <li>3/4 of a frozen bag of your choice of potatoes</li>
        <li>1 pack of preferred bacon</li>
        <li>1 pack of preferred sausage</li>
        <li>1/2 lb of medium cheddar</li>
        <li>Devin's Dank Salsa</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Shred cheese and put in fridge</li>
        <li>Put forzen potatoes in air fryer using instrucitons on bag</li>
        <li>Chop bacon and sausage into 1/2 inch pieces or smaller</li>
        <li>Throw bacon and sausage into skillet and cook all the way through.
            I like to cook bacon first then sausage.
        </li>
        <li>While meats are cooking, I like to crack all of the eggs in a bowl to 
            prepare for scrambling.
        </li>
        <li>Remove bacon and sausage and set inside oven or microwave so it keeps warm</li>
        <li>Remove some of the grease, but leave some for the eggs</li>
        <li>Add bowl of scrambled eggs and cook to your desired doneness or fully scrambled</li>
        <li>Heat up tortillas until soft and warm</li>
        <li>Place one tortilla on a plate and assemble the burrito using all ingredients prepared</li>
        <li>Repeat for other 4 burritos</li>

    </ol>

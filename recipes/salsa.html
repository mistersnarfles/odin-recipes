    <p>This is a recipe for salsa that I've found to be a perfect mix of
        <em>salty</em> and <em>spicy</em>, which is also not overwhelmingly <em>tomato-y</em>.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Large can of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 Large can of El Pato tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 White onion</li>
        <li>1 Head of cilantro</li>
        <li>1 Lime</li>
        <li>3 Serrano peppers</li>
        <li>3 Jalapenos</li>
        <li>1 Tsp oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small pan, spray about 1 tsp of your preferred oil
            so it coats the pan evenly and then, on a low/meidum heat, add all of your serrano peppers and
            jalapenos. Cook the peppers unitl a slight char appears on the entire surface.
        </li>
        <li>While the peppers are charring, take a white onion, cut it in half, dice it and then put it into 
            a large bowl. This bowl will be used for the entire salsa.
        </li>
        <li>Once the peppers are done, remove them from pan, dice them however
            you prefer and then throw into bowl. I like to keep the seeds in, but
            you can remove if you'd like.
        </li>
        <li>Take your cilantro and make sure it is rinsed thoroughly. Once rinsed, fold the entire head together
            evenly and chop finely then throw into bowl.
        </li>
    </ol>
